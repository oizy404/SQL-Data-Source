## SQL Sample Database
This SQL Sample Database called HR that manages the HR data of the small businesses. HR database has seven (7) tables; employees table, dependents table, departments, jobs, locations, countries and regions. These tables stores various data of HR. The database used was the SQL Tutorial sample database which can be found on this [website](https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-sample-database/). 
* The following database diagram illustrates the HR sample database:

### The Database Tables
The HR sample database consists of the following tables:
1. `employees` stores the data of employees.
2. `dependents` stores the employeeâ€™s dependents.
3. `departments` stores department data.
4. `jobs` stores the job data including job title and salary range.
5. `locations` stores the location of the departments of the company.
6. `countries` stores the data of countries where the company is doing business.
7. `regions` stores the data of regions such as Asia, Europe, America, and the Middle East and Africa. The countries are grouped into regions.
### HR Database Dependency Diagram

### Installation
In creating the sample database step by step you can download [here](https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-sample-database/).

OR

Use the [`hr.sql`](https://github.com/oizy404/SQL-Data-Source/blob/main/hr.sql) as sample database and import directly.
